This repository contains an Inventory Management System built as part of my university coursework. The project focuses on managing stock and sales data for a T-shirt retailer, turning raw CSV data into clear inventory reports and simple restocking decisions. It also includes a basic simulation to show how stock levels change over time, along with unit tests to check that the system behaves as expected. The system is written in Python and organised into small, clear modules for sales handling, reporting, restocking, and utilities, making it easy to follow, test, and build on.
